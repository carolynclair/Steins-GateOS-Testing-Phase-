# Steins;GateOS - Testing Phase

A terminal-based operating system simulation inspired by the Future Gadget Laboratory from Steins;Gate.

## Overview

Welcome to the Future Gadget Laboratory's experimental operating system! This is a simulation of an alternate timeline where the lab members created their own OS for conducting time travel experiments and managing future gadgets.

## Features

- **Terminal Interface**: Authentic command-line experience with custom ASCII art
- **Time Operations**: Monitor world lines, check divergence values, and manage time travel data
- **Lab Management**: Keep track of lab members, their ranks, and current status
- **Future Gadget Database**: Catalog and manage experimental devices
- **D-Mail System**: Send messages to the past (simulation)
- **World Line Calculator**: Track changes in timeline divergence

## Installation & Running

1. Clone this repository
2. Make the OS executable: `chmod +x steins_gate_os.py`
3. Run the OS: `python3 steins_gate_os.py`

## Commands

- `help` - Display available commands
- `time` - Show current time and world line status
- `lab` - Display lab member information
- `gadgets` - List future gadgets and their status
- `dmail` - Access the D-Mail system
- `divergence` - Check current world line divergence
- `clear` - Clear the terminal screen
- `status` - Show system status
- `exit` - Exit the OS

## Lab Members

- **Okabe Rintaro (001)** - Mad Scientist, Founder
- **Makise Kurisu (002)** - Assistant, Genius Scientist  
- **Mayuri Shiina (003)** - Hostage, Lab Member No. 002
- **Itaru Hashida (004)** - Super Hacker, Daru

## Technical Details

This OS simulation is built in Python and provides an immersive terminal experience. It maintains state between sessions and includes various Easter eggs and references to the Steins;Gate universe.

## Testing Phase

This is currently in the testing phase. Features may be unstable, and world lines may shift unexpectedly. Use at your own risk!
